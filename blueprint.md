## Project Outline

### Design and Features

*   **Number Display:** A dedicated section to display the 6 generated lottery numbers. The numbers will be presented in a clean, easy-to-read format.
*   **Generate Button:** A user-friendly button to trigger the number generation process.
*   **Styling:**
    *   **Layout:** A centered, responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
    *   **Color Palette:** A modern and vibrant color scheme to create a visually engaging experience.
    *   **Typography:** Clear and legible fonts for readability.
    *   **Effects:** Subtle animations or transitions to enhance user interaction.
    *   **Iconography:** Use of an icon on the button for better user guidance.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45 (inclusive).
    *   The generated numbers will be displayed in ascending order.

### Current Plan

1.  **Modify `index.html`:** Structure the web page with a title, a container for the results, and a "Generate" button.
2.  **Update `style.css`:** Apply modern CSS to style the layout, typography, button, and the number display area for a polished and responsive look.
3.  **Implement `main.js`:** Write the JavaScript logic to handle the button click, generate the unique random numbers, sort them, and dynamically update the DOM to display the results.
